// This class shows the progress of a task.
// It is copied from casacore.
//
// It shows the progress on stdout using a line with dots and percentages.
//
// It is possible to attach the progressmeter to function in, say, a GUI
// that can show the progress in a more visual way.
//
// The progress meter will usually be removed from the screen once the maximum
// value is set, so you should not reuse the ProgressMeter after that has
// happened. It is harmless, but it will not result in any visual feedback for
// the user.
//
// While the "min" is usually less than "max", if in fact it is greater than
// "max" the progress meter will count down correctly.
//
// For example:
// <srcblock>
// void calculate(unsigned int n) {
//   int skip = n / 200;
//   ProgressMeter meter(0, n, "Title", "Subtitle", "", "", true, skip);
//   for (unsigned int i=0; i<n; i++) {
//       ... calculate ...
//       meter.update(i);
//   }
// }
// </srcblock>

    // generated.
    ProgressMeter();

    // Create a progress meter with the given min and max values and labels.
    // if <tt>estimateTime=true</tt>, an estimate of the
    // time remaining will be made for the user. This estimate assumes that
    // the remaining portion will compute at the same rate as the portion
    // completed so far, so the time should not be estimated for processes
    // which are non-linear.
    //
    // Any labels which are set to the empty string will have sensible defaults
    // supplied. In particular, <tt>minlabel</tt> and <tt>maxlabel</tt>
    // will be set to the display the minimum and maximum values.
    //
    // Normally the progress bar will be updated with every call to
    // <tt>update()</tt>. If however you will be sending many events
    // then you might want to update the GUI every <tt>updateEvery</tt>'th
    // event for efficiency. Generally there's no point updating more than
    // a couple of hundred times since the eye can't distinguish differences
    // in the progress bar position at that level. If updateEvery is <=0, it
    // is set to 1 for you.
