    // This class is a DPStep class summing stations to a superstation.
    //
    // It is possible to define one or more groups of stations to be summed.
    // Each group has a name which is the name of the new station.
    // The complex values of baselines are added for which one station occurs
    // in only one group. A baseline is not added if no or both stations are
    // member of a summing group.
    // <br>The summation is done in a weighted way, where the weight of a
    // new station is the sum of the original weights. Optionally weights 1
    // can be used instead of the original weights.
    //
    // Only unflagged data points are used. If too few data points are
    // unflagged, the output data point is flagged.
    //
    // Questions:
    // 1. check if phases do not differ too much? Flag if too much?
    // 2. must all stations exist or possible that some don't?
