/// @brief Step for reading BDA data from an MS.

/// This class is a DPInput step reading the data from a MeasurementSet.
/// At the beginning it finds out the shape of the data; i.e., the
/// number of correlations, channels, baselines, and time slots.
/// It requires the data to be regularly shaped.
///
/// The object is constructed from the 'msin' keywords in the parset file.
/// Currently the following can be given:
/// <ul>
///  <li> msin: name of the MS
///  <li> msin.datacolumn: the data column to use [DATA]
///  <li> msin.weightcolumn: the weights column to use [WEIGHT_SPECTRUM or
///           WEIGHT]
/// </ul>
///
/// The data columns are handled in the following way:
/// <table>
///  <tr>
///   <td>TIME</td>
///   <td>The time slot center of the current data (in MJD seconds).
///       It is assumed that all data have the same interval, which is
///       used to find missing time slots.
///   </td>
///  </tr>
///  <tr>
///   <td>DATA</td>
///   <td>The visibility data as [ncorr,nchan,nbaseline]. Only the
///       part given by startchan and nchan is read. If a time slot is
///       inserted, all its data are zero.
///   </td>
///  </tr>
///  <tr>
///   <td>FLAG</td>
///   <td>The data flags as [ncorr,nchan,nbaseline] (True is bad).
///       They are read from the FLAG column. If a FLAG_ROW is set, all
///       flags for that baseline will be set. Also the flag of data
///       containing NaN or infinite numbers will be set.
///       All flags of an inserted time slot are set.
///   </td>
///  </tr>
///  <tr>
///   <td>WEIGHT</td>
///   <td>The data weights as [ncorr,nchan,nbaseline]. Column
///       WEIGHT_SPECTRUM is used if present and containing valid data,
///       otherwise column WEIGHT is used. The weights of an inserted
///       time slot are set to 0.
///       If autoweight is on, the autocorrelations are used to
///       calculate proper weights.
///   </td>
///  </tr>
///  <tr>
///   <td>UVW</td>
///   <td>The UVW coordinates in meters as [3,nbaseline].
///       They are calculated for a missing time slot.
///   </td>
///  </tr>
///  <tr>
///   <td>FULLRESFLAG</td>
///   <td>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED FOR BDA BUFFERS</td>
///   <td>For each baseline the LOFAR_FULL_RES_FLAG column is stored as
///       a uChar array with shape [orignchan/8, ntimeavg]. The bits
///       represent the flags. They are converted to a Bool array with shape
///       [orignchan, ntimeavg, nbaseline].
///       If column LOFAR_FULL_RES_FLAG is not present, the flags are used
///       and it is assumed that no averaging was done yet (thus ntimeavg=1
///       and orignchan=nchan).
///   </td>
