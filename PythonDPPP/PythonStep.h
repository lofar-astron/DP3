    /// @brief Class to execute a DPStep in some Python module

    /// This class defines a step in the DPPP pipeline to be executed in
    /// Python.
    /// the PythonStep functionality is not directly part of the DPPP program,
    /// but is automatically loaded on demand from a shared library.

    /// The control flow of a python step is as follows:
    /// <ol>
    ///  <li> PythonStep derives from DPStep as all other DPPP steps do.
    ///   Its constructor initializes Python, opens the module given in
    ///   the parset key 'python.module' and creates an instance of the
    ///   class given in 'python.class'.
    ///   That class must derive from the Python class DPStepBase defined
    ///   in __init.py__. The C++ class DPStepBase is the interface for
    ///   callbacks from Python to C++.
    ///  <li> The updateInfo function calls its Python counterpart. The
    ///   DPInfo object is encoded in a dict. Currently, Measure objects
    ///   in DPInfo are not handled yet.
    ///  <li> The process function calls its Python counterpart with the
    ///   time and exposure in the DPBuffer object. The Python class can
    ///   obtain the other dats (visibilities, flags, weights, UVW, modeldata)
    ///   by means of explicit callbacks. This was done for 2 reasons:
    ///   <br>- it makes it possible to directly fill a numpy array.
    ///   <br>- only data really needed is sent.
    ///  <li> When the Python step has output ready, it needs to call the
    ///   processNext function with the data that has changed. Note that
    ///   (as in e.g. class Averager) it is possible that only every N
    ///   input buffers result in an output buffer.
    ///  <li> The finish, show, showCounts, showTimings, and addToMS
    ///   functions call their Python counterparts. The Python base class
    ///   offers default implementations, so they do not need to be
    ///   implemented in a derived Python step class.
    /// </ol>
    /// The class also contains several functions that are basically the
    /// callback function for Python.
