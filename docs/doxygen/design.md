# Design

## DPPP: a framework for streaming radio interferometric pipelines
DPPP (DP3, short for Default PreProcessing Pipeline) is a framework
for efficiently processing time-ordered visibilities,
e.g. freshly correlated data. It was developed for the LOFAR
telescope, and is used for preprocessing its imaging pipelines.
DPPP user documentation is found at the [Read The Docs page](../index.html).

For avoiding high memory usage, DPPP reads the input data in chunks instead of reading all input data at once. 
For each chunk, it calls all the steps to do the processing on this data. The last step will then
write out the processed data.

DPPP runs a pipeline in clearly defined stages, to make spotting
errors as easy as possible.
* **Initialise** This connects all the processing steps together. This step is data independent.
* **Tune At** This stage reads metadata, such as the number of channels, and adjusts the steps accordingly.
* **Process** This stage pipes the data through the steps, one buffer at a time. The steps define the buffer size.

## Measurement Set standard
DPPP adheres to the Measurement Set (MS) standard, which is the common format for radio telescope data. DPPP can
also create a new MS. When an appropriate input step is in
place (e.g. a streaming connection to a correlator), MSs can
be written from scratch.

DPPP supports only regularly shaped MSs with the following restrictions:
- Every time slot has the same number of antennas.
- Time slots have the same duration and are equally spaced (missing time slots are allowed).
- Every integration has the same number of correlations and channels.
- Only one spectral window can be handled.

## Built-in steps
DPPP contains built-in steps that are linked together and process one time slot at a time. This way, DPPP is therefore suitable for large measurement sets.
All the built-in steps derive from the [DPStep](@ref DP3::DPPP::DPStep) class. 
Its inheritance diagram shows all step types, including the built-in steps.

[DPRun](@ref DP3::DPPP::DPRun) initialises and orchestrates the configured steps.
It begins with setting the required info for the first step and its next step(s).
Next, each buffer (containing a single time slot) is processed by the first step.
When processed, it invokes the process function of the next step.
Once all buffers are processed, DPPP calls the `finish` function of the first step and subsequent steps. 
This function flushes all remaining data from the steps to their output channel(s).
Finally, DPPP calls the `addToMS` function on each step for updating the metadata of the MS.
The figure below gives a graphical overview of the [DPStep](@ref DP3::DPPP::DPStep) flow.

### Calibration
The DPPP step [GainCal](@ref DP3::DPPP::GainCal) implements many variants of direction
independent calibration. It uses [StefCal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6930038), with many
extra features, such as fitting a function over frequency.
Also full-Jones calibration is supported. Results are written
to [ParmDB](https://www.astron.nl/lofarwiki/doku.php?id=public:user_software:documentation:makesourcedb); [H5Parm](https://github.com/revoltek/losoto/wiki/H5parm-specifications) support is in development.

### AOFlagger
DPPP contains a DPStep class which is a shallow wrapper that calls AOFlagger.
This makes it possible to flag with AOFlagger and immediately
afterwards average the data, without writing the
data to disk in between.

### User-defined steps
Apart from the built-in steps, also custom steps can
be defined, following the existing interface description.
Recompiling DPPP is not necessary: steps are found as shared
libraries.

A special custom step is the [Python step](@ref DP3::DPPP::PythonStep), which uses a step defined in a Python module. 
This makes it very easy to implement custom steps even for non C++-wizards. An
example Python step is bundled with the LOFAR software.

## Example reduction
Arguments are given to DPPP as a 'parameter set', a simple
key-value format. Optionally, parameters can be overridden
on the command line. The example also shows that you can 
use the out step to store intermediate results.

    msin = [bla.MS, bla2.MS]
    steps = [aoflag, avg1, out1, cal, out2, avg2 ]
    avg1.type = average
    avg1.timestep = 4 # Average down every 4 timeslots
    out1.type = out
    out1.name = myfile_averaged.MS
    cal.type = calibrate
    cal.skymodel = 3C196.skymodel
    cal.applysolution = true
    cal.parmdb = instrument.parmdb
    out2.type = out
    out2.name = .
    out2.datacolumn = CORRECTED_DATA
    avg2.type = average
    avg2.timestep = 2 # average down some more
    avg2.freqstep = 16
    msout = bla_combined.MS
