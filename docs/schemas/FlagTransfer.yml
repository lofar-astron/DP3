  Transfer flags from a lower-resolution MeasurementSet (MS). In case there is a mismatch between the input MS and `source_ms`, e.g., in terms of baselines, a filter can be applied. Hence, options of the Filter step are also valid. In that case Dp3 doesn't check whether the same stations are present, just that the number of baselines is the same. Note: this is an experimental feature.

  Deprecation warning: this step will be replaced by ``transfer``, which transfers both flags and data. Please use ``transfer`` with ``flags`` set to ``True`` instead.
inputs:
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'flagtransfer'.
  source_ms:
    type: string
    doc: >-
      Low resolution MS from which to extract flags. This MS must be an averaged version of the main input MS.
