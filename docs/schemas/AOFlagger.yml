description: >-
  Automatic flagging in time/freq windows using Andre Offringa's advanced aoflagger.
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step `.`
    default: aoflag
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'aoflagger' (or 'aoflag') `.`
    default: aoflag
  count&#46;save:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    doc: >-
      If true, the flag percentages per frequency are saved to a table with
      extension ``.flagfreq`` and percentages per station to a table with extension
      ``.flagstat``. The basename of the table is the MS name (without extension)
      followed by the stepname and extension.
  count&#46;path:
    type: string
    default: "\"\""
    doc: >-
      The directory where to create the flag percentages table. If empty, the
      path of the input MS is used `.`
  strategy:
    type: File?
    doc:  >-
      The name of the strategy file to use. If no name is given, 
      the default strategy is used which is fine for HBA. 
      For LBA data the strategy `LBAdefault` should be used.
  memoryperc:
    type: int
    default: 0
    doc: >-
      If >0, percentage of the machines memory to use. If `memorymax` nor
      `memoryperc` is given, all memory will be used (minus 2 GB (at most 50%) for
      other purposes). Accepts only integer values (LOFAR v2.16). Limiting the
      available memory too much affects flagging accuracy; in general try to use
      at least 10 GB of memory.
  memorymax:
    type: float
    default: 0
    doc: >-
      Maximum amount of memory (in GB) to use. ⇐0 means no maximum. As stated
      above, this affects flagging accuracy `.`
  timewindow:
    type: int
    default: 0
    doc: >-
      Number of time slots to be flagged jointly. The larger the time window,
      the better the flagging performs. 0 means that it will be deduced from the
      memory to use. Note that the time window can be extended with an overlap
      on the left and right side to minimize possible boundary effects `.`
  overlapperc:
    type: float
    default: 0
    doc: >-
      If >0, percentage of time window to be added to the left and right side
      for overlap purposes (to minimize boundary effects). If `overlapmax` is not
      given, it defaults to 1%.
  overlapmax:
    type: int
    default: 0
    doc: Maximum overlap value (0 is no maximum) `.`
  autocorr:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    doc: Flag autocorrelations `?`
  pulsar:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    doc: Use flagging strategy optimized for pulsar observations `?`
  pedantic:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    doc: Be more pedantic when flagging `?`
  keepstatistics:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    doc: Write the quality statistics `?`
