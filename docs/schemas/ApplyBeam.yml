description: >-
  Apply the LOFAR beam model, or the inverse of it.
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step `.`
    default: applybeam
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'applybeam' `.`
    default: applybeam
  direction:
    type: string?
    doc: >-
      A RA/Dec value specifying in what direction to correct the beam. See ``phaseshift.phasecenter`` for syntax.
      If empty, the beam is corrected in the direction of the current phase center.
  beamproximitylimit:
    type: float
    default: 60
    doc: >-
      If non-zero, sources that are near each other are clustered and the
      beam is only calculated for each cluster. This trades an increase in
      speed for a very low level of loss in accuracy.
      This parameter is ignored in the ApplyBeam step itself, and should
      instead be used as part of predict, ddecal, gaincal,
      h5parmpredict, etc. This parameter has been introduced in Dec 2020 `.`
  onebeamperpatch:
    type: string?
    default: false
    doc: >-
      Deprecated: use beamproximitylimit instead.
      When ``true``, computes the beam only for the center of each patch
      (saves computation time, but you should set this to ``false`` for large
      patches).
      In the ApplyBeam step, this setting does not make sense
      (but it does if the applybeam is part of predict, ddecal, gaincal,
      h5parmpredict, etc.).
      Generally, ``false`` is the right setting for this option.
      The default has changed to false in Nov 2018 `.`
  usechannelfreq:
    type: boolean?
    default: true
    doc: >-
      Compute the beam for each channel of the measurement set separately.
      This is useful for merged / concatenated measurement sets.
      For raw LOFAR data you should set it to ``false``,
      so that the beam will be formed as in the station hardware.
      Also, setting it to false is faster `.`
  updateweights:
    type: boolean?
    doc: >-
      Update the weights column, in a way consistent with
      the weights being inverse proportional to the autocorrelations
      (e.g. if 'autoweights' was used before) `.`
  invert:
    type: boolean?
    default: true
    doc: >-
      Invert the corrections, to correct the data. Default is ``true``.
      If you want to corrupt the data, set it to ``false`` `.`
  beammode:
    type: enum
    symbols: array_factor, element, full, default
    default: default
    doc: >-
      Beam mode to apply, can be ``array_factor``, ``element``, ``full``, or
      ``default`` (same as ``full``). The mode ``full`` applies both the element
      beam and the array factor `.`
