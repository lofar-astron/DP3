  "Filter on baseline and/or channel (only the given baselines/channels are kept). The reader step has an implicit filter."
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step `.`
    default: filter
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'filter' `.`
    default: filter
  startchan:
    default: 0
    type: integer
    doc: >-
      First channel to use from the input MS (channel numbers start 
      counting at 0). Note that skipped channels will not be written 
      into the output MS. It can be an expression with ``nchan`` 
      (nr of input channels) as parameter. E.g. ``nchan/32``
      will be fine for LOFAR observations with 64 and 256 channels. 
  nchan:
    default: 0
    type: integer
    doc: >-
      Number of channels to use from the input MS (0 means till the end). 
      It can be an expression with ``nchan`` (nr of input channels) as 
      parameter. E.g. ``15*nchan/16``
  baseline:
    default: "\"\""
    type: string
    doc: >-
      Baseline to keep using a selection string. See :ref:`Description of baseline selection parameters`. 
  blrange:
    default: "\"\""
    type: array
    doc: >-
      Baseline to keep using a range. See :ref:`Description of baseline selection parameters`. 
  corrtype:
    default: '""'
    type: string
    doc: >-
      Correlation type to match? Must be auto, cross, or an empty string `.` 
  remove:
    default: false
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      If true, the stations not used in any baseline will be removed from 
      the ANTENNA subtable and the antenna ids in the main table will be 
      renumbered accordingly. To have a consistent output MeasurementSet, 
      other subtables (FEED, POINTING, SYSCAL, LOFAR_ANTENNA_FIELD, 
      LOFAR_ELEMENT_FAILURE, and QUALITY_BASELINE_STATISTIC) will also 
      be updated. Note that stations filtered previously (e.g. using 
      msselect) will also be removed, even if no baseline selection is 
      done in the filter step `.`
