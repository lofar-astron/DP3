  Average data in time and/or freq.
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step `.`
    default: average
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'averager' (or equivalent 'average' or 'squash') `.`
    default: averager
  timestep:
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Number of time slots to average. It is truncated if exceeding the actual
      number of times `.`
    default: 1
  freqstep:
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Number of channels to average. It is truncated if exceeding the actual
      number of channels `.`
    default: 1
  minpoints:
    type: int
    doc: >-
      If number of averaged unflagged input points < minpoints, the averaged
      point is flagged `.`
    default: 0
  minperc:
    type: float
    doc: Like minpoints, but expressed as a percentage of timestep*freqstep. `.`
    default: 0
  timeresolution:
    type: float
    doc: >-
      Target time resolution, in seconds. If this is given, and bigger than
      zero, it overrides `<step>.timestep`
    default: 0
  freqresolution:
    type: float
    doc: >-
      Target frequency resolution, in Hz (or append "MHz" or "kHz" to specify it
      in those units). If this is given, and bigger than zero, it overrides
      ``<step>.freqstep``.
    default: 0
