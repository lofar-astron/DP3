description: |
  Transfer data and flags from a lower-resolution MeasurementSet (MS). In case there is a mismatch between the input MS and `source_ms`, e.g., in terms of baselines, a filter can be applied. Hence, options of the Filter step are also valid. In that case DP3 doesn't check whether the same stations are present, just that the number of baselines is the same.  
inputs:
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'transfer'.
  source_ms:
    type: string
    doc: >-
      Low resolution MS from which to extract data or flags. This MS must be an averaged version of the main input MS.
  data:
    type: bool
    default: false
    doc: >-
      Transfer data from ``source_ms`` to the MeasurementSet specified with ``msin``.
  flags:
    type: bool
    default: false
    doc: >-
      Transfer flags from ``source_ms`` to the MeasurementSet specified with ``msin``.
  datacolumn:
    type: string
    default: DATA
    doc: >-
      The data column to use, i.e., the name of the column in ``source_ms`` in which the visibilities that are to be transfered are stored.
