  Apply an existing calibration to a MeasurementSet.
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step `.`
    default: applycal
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'applycal' (or 'correct') `.`
    default: applycal
  parmdb:
    type: string
    doc: Path of parmdb in which the parameters are stored. This can also be an H5Parm file, in that case the filename has to end in '.h5' `.`
  solset:
    type: string?
    doc: >-
      In case of applying an H5Parm file: the name of the solset to be used.
      If empty, defaults to the name of one solset present in the H5Parm
      (if more solsets are present in an H5Parm and solset is left empty,
       an error will be thrown) `.`
  correction:
    type: enum
    symbols: gain, tec, clock, rotationangle, rotation, scalarphase, scalaramplitude, rotationmeasure, fulljones
    doc: >-
      Type of correction to perform, can be one of 'gain', 'tec', 'clock',
      '(common)rotationangle' / 'rotation', '(common)scalarphase',
      '(common)scalaramplitude' or 'rotationmeasure'
      (create multiple ApplyCal steps for multiple corrections).
      When using H5Parm,
      this is for now the name of the soltab;
      the type will be deduced from the metadata in that soltab,
      except for full Jones, in which case correction should be 'fulljones' `.`
  soltab:
    type: string[]?
    doc: >-
     The name or names of the H5 soltab.
     Currently only used when ``correction=fulljones``,
     in which case soltab should list two names (amplitude and phase soltab).
  direction:
    type: string?
    doc: If using H5Parm, the direction of the solution to use `.`
  updateweights:
    type: boolean?
    doc: >-
      Update the weights column, in a way consistent with
      the weights being inverse proportional to the autocorrelations
      (e.g. if 'autoweights' was used before) `.`
  interpolation:
    default: nearest
    type: enum
    symbols: nearest, linear
    doc: If using H5Parm, the type of interpolation (in time and frequency) to use, can be one of 'nearest' or 'linear' `.`
  invert:
    default: true
    type: boolean?
    doc: >-
     Invert the corrections, to correct the data. Default is true.
     If you want to corrupt the data, set it to ``false``
  timeslotsperparmupdate:
    type: int?
    doc: >-
      Number of time slots to handle after one read of the parameter file.
      Optimization to prevent spurious reading from the parmdb `.`
  interpolation:
    default: "[]"
    type: list
    doc: >-
      (new in version 3.1) ApplyCal substeps, e.g. [myApplyCal1, myApplyCal2]. 
      Their parameters can be specified through e.g. 
      ``<step>.myApplyCal1.correction=tec``. If a parameter is not given for 
      the substep, it takes the value from ``<step>``.
