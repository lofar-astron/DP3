  tolerance:
    default: 1e-5
    type: double
    doc: >-
      Controls the accuracy to be reached: when the normalized solutions move less than this value, the solutions are considered to be converged and the algorithm finishes. Lower values will cause more iterations to be performed `.`
  minvisratio:

  approxchunksize:
    default: 0
    type: int
    doc: Size of fitted chunksize during approximation stage in nr of channels. With approxchunksize=1 the constraint is disabled during the approx stage (so channels are solved for independently). Once converged, the solutions are constrained and more iterations are performed until that has converged too. The default is approxchunksize=0, which calculates the chunksize from the bandwidth (resulting in 10 chunks per octave of bandwidth) `.`
  approxtolerance:
    default: tolerance*10
    type: double
    doc: Tolerance at which the approximating first stage is considered to be converged and the second full-constraining stage is started.

  nchan:
    default: 1
    type: int
    doc: Number of channels in each channel block, for which the solution is assumed to be constant. The default is 1, meaning one solution per channel (or in the case of constraints, fitting the constraint over all channels individually). 0 means one solution for the whole channel range.

      Use rotation referencing with the first antenna as the reference antenna.
      When enabled, the first antenna gets a rotation angle of 0.
      The rotation angle of the other antennas will be relative to the first antenna.

      reference antenna, and so on.
      This setting is only effective when ``mode=rotation+diagonal`` `.`
