  The parameters in the parset are divided into several groups like input (msin), output (msout), madflagger, average, preflagger, and uvwflagger. 
  Because multiple flagging and averaging steps can be specified, their parameters have to be prefixed with the step name as shown in the example above.
inputs:
  steps:
    type: string?
    doc: >-
      Names of the steps to perform. Each step has to be defined using the step name as a prefix. The step ``type`` parameter defines the type of step (averager, madflagger, preflagger, uvwflagger, counter). The step type defaults to the name of the step, which is especially handy for count steps. ``msin`` and ``msout`` are implicit steps which should not be given here. An empty vector ``[]`` means that the input MS is copied to the output MS while flagging NaN and infinite numbers. Note that a step name can be used more than once meaning that the same step will be executed multiple times (e.g., multiple times count) `.`
  numthreads:
    default: ${OMP_NUM_THREADS}
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Maximum number of threads to use `.`
  showprogress:
    default: true
    type: bool
    doc: >-
      Show a progress bar `?`
  showcounts:
    default: true
    type: bool
    doc: >-
      Show flagging statistics `?`
  showtimings:
    default: true
    type: bool
    doc: >-
      At the end the percentage of elapsed time each step took can be shown; the overall time is always shown `.`
  checkparset:
    default: 0
    type: integer
    doc: >-
      What to do if parameters in the ParSet file are not used. -1 means ignore. 0 means give a warning showing those parameters. In this way misspelled parameters can be detected. 1 means give an error and stop. For backward compatibility False (0) and True (1) can also be given `.`
  uselogger:
    default: false
    type: bool
    doc: >-
      If false, all DP3 messages are written on stdout. If true, the logging framework is used `.`
