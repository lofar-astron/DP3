  SetBeam is an expert option and should only be used in rare cases. It allows direct manipulation of the beam-keywords for a 
  column in a measurement set. Normally, DP3 registers whether the visibilities in a column are corrected for a beam or not, and if so, 
  in what direction the beam was corrected for. This avoids incorrect corrections / scaling by the beam. However, certain actions 
  can change the scaling of the visibilities without that the beam keywords are changed, in particular when predicting (either with DP3 or with another tool). 
  When predicting a single source and not applying the beam, the visibilities are 'corrected' for the beam in the direction of the source. 
  Under those circumstances, SetBeam can be used to modify the beam keywords. In that case, set ''direction'' to the source direction and ``beammode`` to default.
inputs:
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'setbeam' `.`
  direction:
    default: "[]"
    type: string?
    doc: A RA/Dec value specifying in what direction the beam is corrected `.`
  beammode:
    default: "default"
    type: string
    doc: Beam mode to apply, can be "array_factor", "element" or "default". Default means that sources in the given direction have corrected (intrinsic) flux values, i.e. they are corrected for the full beam `.`
