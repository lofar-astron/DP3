  Flag based on UVW coordinates, possibly in the direction of another source.
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step `.`
    default: applybeam
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'applybeam' `.`
    default: applybeam
  stations:
    type: record
    doc: >-
      One or more names of new stations each followed by the list of 
      stations it consists of. A station name in the list can be a 
      glob-like pattern. Optionally such a pattern can be negated by a 
      ! or ^ meaning that names matching that pattern are excluded from 
      the selection so far. For example:
      ``stations={ST6:'CS00[2-7]*'}`` can be used to form the superstation from 
      all superterp stations. ``{ST6:['CS00[2-7]*','!CS005*']}`` is similar, 
      but excludes CS005. ``{ST001:[CS001,CS002,CS003], ST002:[CS004,CS005,CS006]}`` 
      defines 2 new stations ST001 and ST002 
      consisting of the stations in the lists following their names. 
  minpoints:
    default: 1
    type: integer
    doc: >-
      Flag a new data point if number of unflagged data points 
      added is less than `minpoints`` `.`
  useweights:
    default: true
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      Use the input data weights? False means all input visibilities 
      have weight 1 `.`
  average:
    default: true
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      Is a visibility of a new station the weighted average of its input 
      visibilities and its UVW the weighted average of the input UVWs `?`
  autocorr:
    default: false
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      Form new auto-correlations `?`
  sumauto :
    default: true
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      Sum auto- or cross-correlations to form new auto-correlations `?`
