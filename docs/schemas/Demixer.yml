    default: demix
  type:
    type: string

    default: demixer
  baseline:

    default: []
    type: double[]

  corrtype:
    default: cross
    type: string
    doc: >-
      Baselines to demix. Correlation type to match? Must be auto, cross, or an
      empty string `.`
  timestep:
    default: 1
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Number of time slots to average when subtracting. It is truncated if
      exceeding the actual number of times. Note that the data itself will also
      be averaged by this amount `.`
  freqstep:
    default: 1
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Number of channels to average when subtracting. It is truncated if
      exceeding the actual number of channels. Note that the data itself will
      also be averaged by this amount `.`
  demixtimestep:
    default: 0
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Number of time slots to average when demixing. It is truncated if
      exceeding the actual number of times. It defaults to the averaging used
      for the subtract `.`
  demixfreqstep:
    default: 0
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Number of channels to average when demixing. It is truncated if exceeding
      the actual number of channels. It defaults to the averaging used for the
      subtract `.`
  ntimechunk:
    default: 0
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Number of demix time slots (after averaging) that are processed jointly in
      as much a parallel way as possible. If subtract uses different time
      averaging, it has to fit integrally `.`
  skymodel:
    default: sky
    type: string
    doc: Sourcedb (created with `makesourcedb`) with the sky model to calibrate on `.` When the path ends with ``.skymodel`` or ``.txt`` DP3 expects a skymodel file as used by makesourcedb. This makes it possible to directly use a skymodel file without using makesourcedb to convert the file.
  instrumentmodel:
    default: instrument
    type: string
    doc: >-
      The name of the ParmDB to use. The ParmDB does not need to exist. If it
      does not exist it will be created `.`
  subtractsources:
    default: "[]"
    type: string[]?
    doc: >-
      Names of the sources to subtract. If none are given, demixing comes down
      to averaging. The sources must exist as patches in the SourceDB `.`
  modelsources:
    default: "[]"
    type: string[]
    doc: >-
      Names of sources with models to take into account when solving. the
      sources must exist as patches in the SourceDB. Note that the target should
      NOT be part of this parameter. If a model of the target has to be used, it
      has to be given in parameter ``targetsource``.
  targetsource:
    default: "\"\""
    type: string
    doc: >-
      It can be used to specify the name of the source model of the target. If
      given, the target source model (its patch in the SourceDB) is taken into
      account when solving; in this case parameter ``othersources`` cannot be given.
      It cannot be given if ``ignoretarget=true``. If not given, the target is
      projected away or ignored (depending on parameter ``ignoretarget``).
  ignoretarget:
    default: false
    type: boolean
    doc: false = project the target source away; true = ignore the target `.`
  othersources:
    default: "[]"
    type: string[]
    doc: >-
      Names of sources of which the direction is taken into account when
      demixing by projecting the directions away. The direction needs to be
      specified if the source is unknown (which is usually the case). It can be
      done using parameters ``<step>.<sourcename>.phasecenter``.
  propagatesolutions:
    default: true
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      If set to true, solutions of a time slot are used as initial values for
      the next time slot. If set to false, the diagonal elements of the Jones
      matrix are initialized to one and the off-diagonal elements to zero `.`
  defaultgain:
    default: 1
    type: double
    doc: >-
      The default and initial gain for the directional gains that are computed
      internally `.`
  maxiter:
    default: 50
    type: int
    doc: Maximum number of iterations used in the LM solve `.`
  uselbfgssolver:
    default: false
    type: boolean 
    doc: >-
      If true, use LBFGS solver instead of the LM solver (or LSQfit) `.`
  lbfgs`.`historysize:
    default: 10
    type: int
    doc: >-
      If using the LBFGS solver, the history size, specified as a multiple of the 
      parameter vector, to use to approximate the inverse Hessian `.`
  lbfgs`.`robustdof:
    default: 2.0
    type: double
    doc: >-
      If using the LBFGS solver, the degrees of freedom given to the noise model.
      The larger this becomes (more than 30), the noise model behaves as a Gaussian.
      The smaller values make the noise model more robust to outliers in the data `.`
