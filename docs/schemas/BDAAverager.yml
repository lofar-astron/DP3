description: >-
  Average data in time and/or frequency, depending on baseline lenghts. For
  shorter baselines, the averaging factor is higher than for longer baselines `.`
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step `.`
    default: bdaaverage
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'bdaaverager' `.`
    default: bdaaverager
  timebase:
    type: double
    doc: >-
      The baseline length (in meters) after which the averager does not perform
      any averaging over time. The BDA time averaging factor for a baseline becomes
      timebase / baseline length, rounded down.
      The maximum time interval will be clipped to maxinterval `.`
    default: 0.0
  frequencybase:
    type: int
    doc: >-
      The baseline length (in meters) after which the averager does not perform
      any averaging over frequencies. The number of channels for a baseline
      becomes baseline length / frequencybase * original number of
      channels, rounded up.
      The minchannels setting specifies the minimum number of channels.
      The maximum numbef of channels is the original number of channels `.`
    default: 0.0
  maxinterval:
    type: int
    doc: >-
      The maximum interval duration (in seconds), when averaging over time.
      This setting allows limiting the time averaging factor for short baselines.
      This value is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the integration time.
      When this value is 0.0, there is no limit on the interval duration `.`
    default: 0.0
  minchannels:
    type: int
    doc: >-
      The minimum number of channels in an averaged baseline. This setting
      allows limiting the frequency averaging factor for short baselines `.`
    default: 1
