/**
 * @brief The lane is an efficient cyclic buffer that is synchronized.
 * @details
 * A lane can typically be used in a multi-threaded producer-consumer
 * situation. The lane also holds a state which allows for
 * an ellegant way of communicating from producer(s) to
 * consumer(s) that all data has been produced.
 * 
 * A simple example:
 * @code
 * void producer(lane<Task>* taskLane)
 * {
 *   while(moreTasks)
 *     taskLane->write(nextTask());
 *   taskLane->write_end();
 * }
 * 
 * void consumer(lane<Task>* taskLane)
 * {
 *   Task task;
 *   while(taskLane->read(task))
 *     processTask(task);
 * }
 * 
 * void run()
 * {
 *   lane<Task> taskLane;
 *   std::thread consumerThread(&consumer(), &taskLane);
 *   producer(&taskLane);
 *   consumerThread.join();
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * The various read and write methods, as well as the empty(),
 * capacity() and size() methods are always thread safe. The other
 * methods are not: assignment, swap(), clear() and resize() can not
 * be called from a different thread while another thread is also
 * accessing the lane. The same holds obviously for the constructors
 * and destructor. This is chosen because these methods should almost never
 * be called in parallel with other methods, and hence it is not worth
 * to increase every call with extra locks to make this possible.
 * 
 * With one reader and one writer, the order is guaranteed to be consistent.
 * With multiple readers or writers in combination with multi-element
 * write or read functions, a sequence of symbols might be interrupted. For
 * example, if a multi-element write() won't fit completely in the buffer,
 * the thread will wait for free space. Another thread might get now write
 * access first, causing the single call to the multi-element write to be
 * "split up".
 * 
 * @author Andre Offringa
 * @tparam Tp Type of elements to be stored in the lane.
