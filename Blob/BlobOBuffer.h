/// \brief Abstract base class for output buffer for a blob

/// @{

/// BlobOBuffer is the abstract base class for the sink of a
/// BlobOStream object. In this way the destination of a BlobOStream
/// can be chosen as needed. Currently three sink types are possible:
/// <ul>
/// <li> BlobOBufStream uses an ostream as the sink. It is mainly
///      meant to write blobs into a file, socket, etc.
/// <li> BlobOBufVector<T> uses a vector<T> (where T is char or uchar)
///      as the sink. It is mainly meant for creating blobs to be
///      stored using the classes in the LCS Persistent Object Layer.
/// <li> BlobOBufChar uses a plain C-array as the sink. It serves as
///      a helper class for BlobOBufVector, but can also be used in itself.
/// </ul>
