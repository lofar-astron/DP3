/// \brief Abstract base class for input buffer for a blob

/// @{

/// BlobIBuffer is the abstract base class for the source of a
/// BlobIStream object. In this way the source of a BlobIStream
/// can be chosen as needed. Currently three source types are possible:
/// <ul>
/// <li> BlobIBufStream uses an istream as the source. It is mainly
///      meant to read blobs from a file, socket, etc.
/// <li> BlobIBufChar uses a plain C-array as the source. Its mainly used
///      as a helper class, but can also be used in itself.
/// <li> BlobIBufVector<T> uses a vector<T> (where T is char or uchar)
///      as the source.
///      It uses BlobIBufChar to do the actual work.
/// <li> BlobIBufString uses a BlobString as the source.
///      It uses BlobIBufChar to do the actual work.
///      It is mainly meant for reading blobs stored using the LCS
///      Persistency Layer.
/// </ul>
