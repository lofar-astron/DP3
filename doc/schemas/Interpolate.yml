  The interpolate step replaces flagged values by interpolating them using “neighbouring” 
  samples (samples close in time and frequency). It calculates the Gaussian weighted sum over 
  non-flagged samples, with a sigma parameter of one timestep/one channel. The flags are removed after interpolation. 
  This is in particular useful in combination with averaging; by replacing flagged values before averaging, the output 
  visibilities will more accurately represent the true sky. This step was aimed to solve frequency structure from 
  flagging/averaging for the EoR experiment, but might be useful in other cases as a more accurate averaging step. 
  Details are published in `Offringa, Mertens and Koopmans (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04752>`__.
