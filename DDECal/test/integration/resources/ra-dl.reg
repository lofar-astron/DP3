# Small facet that covers the ra pixel (400,256), with a dl offset relative
# to that pixel. Polygon is (384,240) (384,272) (401,272) (401,240).

# For debugging or future testing: Very small facet, effectively 20x20 pixels.
# With this facet, IDG only creates zero visibilities, since it is smaller
# than the internal sub grid size in IDG.
# The polygon is (384,248) (384,264) (401,264) (401,248).
